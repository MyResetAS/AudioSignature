**AudioSignature™** is an original concept for embedding a recognizable voice phrase or sound identity within musical tracks.  
It can appear at any position in the track (not limited to intro or outro) and acts as a creative signature for the artist — similar to a visual logo, but in sound.

This concept was created to redefine musical authorship through personalized sound branding and empower artists with a new method of self-identification.
