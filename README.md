# AudioSignature™

**Created by Svetlana Bormotova (my reset)**

**AudioSignature™** is a concept for embedding a recognizable voice phrase or sound identity within musical tracks. It can appear anywhere in the track and acts as a creative signature — like a sonic logo for the artist.

This concept redefines musical authorship through personalized sound branding and provides artists with a new form of identity.
